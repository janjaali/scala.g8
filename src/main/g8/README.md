# $project_name$

This project has been generated by janjaali/scala.g8 template.

## Run the main application

sbt "app/run"

## Create executables

This project uses [sbt-native-packager](https://sbt-native-packager.readthedocs.io/) to create executables.

### Application

To create an executable script which launches the main application you can command sbt to create a staged application via:

```shell
sbt "app/stage"
```

This will bundle and create the executable script to launch the application in [.\app\target\universal\stage](.\app\target\universal\stage). The script is executable via

```powershell
.\app\target\universal\stage\bin\app.bat
```

### Dockerized

To create a docker image that contains the main application, you can use the sbt command:

```shell
sbt "app/docker:publishLocal"
```

This will build and publish an image called "$organization$/$project_name;format="lower,hyphen"$:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT". You can run the image via:

```shell
docker run -it $organization$/$project_name;format="lower,hyphen"$:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
```

## Test

sbt test
